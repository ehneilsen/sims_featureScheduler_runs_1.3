New things compared to the v1.2 baseline

* Deep Drilling Fields constraints not as tight, so they should execute more often
* Including a basis function to drive at least 3 observations per year per filter
* Rotational dithering (a rotTelpos value between -87 and 87 degrees is selected nightly)
* Spatial dithering (0.7 degrees) and rotational dithering included for DDFs
* New explicit planet masking basis function
