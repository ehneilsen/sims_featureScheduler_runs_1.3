## Simple Rolling

These experiments vary rolling sizes of 1/ 2,3,5,10. These are "simple" in the sense that rolling is always happening, not taking into account that we would want full sky coverage in years 1 and 10.  The advantage of the simple rolling is that there are 10 full seasons of rolling.

## Delayed Rolling

Again, variations on the size and strength of the rolling region.  These are "delayed" because the rolling behavior doesn't start until 1.5 years have elapsed.
