An attempt to have the deep drilling fields execute in the way proposed by Brandt et al (Active Galaxy Science in the LSST Deep-Drilling Fields)

Note that since the DDF sequences are much shorter, they no longer count as being "paired" for solar system observations. It may be important to check that in this plan solar system objects can still be rejected from other transients in the DDFs.
