Inspired by the Rothchild et al AltSched.  

Things of note:

* The entire footprint is treated the same (no change for the galactic plane, North Ecliptic Spurr, etc)
* y-band is only taken in or near twilgiht
* A basis function alternates putting weight on the North and South. This drives the desireable ~0.5 day^-1 cadence
* Variations with large and small total footprints
